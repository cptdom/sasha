Sasha is supposed to be a simple, yet powerful, helpful tool that provides a shell-like interface to enable browsing in a data storage.

## Storages to be used
- S3 (priority)
- Redis (second degree priority, some time in the future...)

## Commands to support - MVP
- `cd` OK
- `ls` OK
- `file` OK

## NTH features in the future
- bash-like interface (tab completion support)
- `cp`
- `mv`
- `rm`
- `mkdir`
- `touch`
- most commonly used flags

### S3-specific behaviour
